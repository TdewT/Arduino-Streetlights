# Arduino-Streetlights
 Simple arduino code to control streetlights, for my semester project.

## Features

- Custom StreetLight object for easy control over the lights and addition of new ones.
- Button toggle for yellow flashing mode.
- Dynamically changing brightness for streetlights, based on ambience lighting, using a photo-resistor.
